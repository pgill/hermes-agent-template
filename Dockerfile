# repo publishes — a release tag (recommended for reproducibility) or a
# branch name (`main`) for bleeding edge.
#
# To bump: check https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/releases for the
# newest tag (format `vYYYY.M.D`, optionally with a `.PATCH` suffix, e.g.
# `v2026.5.29.2`) and update the default below. Use `main` only if you accept
# that every rebuild can pull arbitrary new upstream commits.

# tini = tiny init that we run as PID 1. Without it, hermes's grandchild
# processes (MCP stdio servers, git, bun, browser daemons spawned by tools)
# reparent to PID 1 when their parents exit and pile up as zombies. After
# weeks of uptime that exhausts the kernel's PID table → "fork: cannot
# allocate memory" and the container dies. tini reaps zombies in the
# background and forwards SIGTERM/SIGINT to our entrypoint so Railway's
# stop signal still triggers our graceful shutdown. Standard container init
# (same as Docker's `--init` flag and Kubernetes' pause container).
#
# Node.js is required only at build time to compile the Hermes React dashboard.
# We strip the source + apt lists afterwards to keep the image lean.

# Install hermes-agent (provides the `hermes` CLI) and pre-build its React
# dashboard so `hermes dashboard` has nothing to build at runtime.
#
# [all] in v2026.6.5 no longer pulls in [dev]; messaging platforms, TTS, and
# other heavy backends are lazy-installed by hermes at first use. We pre-install
# the ones this template actually uses so first-message latency is instant.
# `vision` (Pillow) is a soft-dep that is NOT in [all] and is otherwise
# lazy-installed at first image use: without it hermes can't downscale an
# oversized image (>5 MB / >8000px), which then bakes into immutable history
# and bricks the session on Anthropic's non-retryable 400. We bake it in.
# When bumping HERMES_REF, re-check hermes-agent's pyproject.toml [all] and
# the extras below against the new release's pyproject.toml.

# Why pre-build ui-tui (and why we don't delete it after):
# - The dashboard's embedded Chat tab spawns `node ui-tui/dist/entry.js`
#   on every WebSocket connect to /api/pty.
# - Without HERMES_TUI_DIR, hermes's _make_tui_argv falls through to the
#   npm install + build path (since git-editable installs don't have the
#   bundled tui_dist/ that PyPI wheels include), adding 30-60s to the
#   first chat-open and blocking the asyncio event loop.
# - Pre-building at image time surfaces build failures here rather than
#   at user request time, and makes first-chat-open instant.
# - We keep ui-tui/ entirely (node_modules + dist + src) so HERMES_TUI_DIR
#   can point at it (see below).
